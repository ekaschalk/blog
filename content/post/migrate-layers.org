#+TITLE: Migrating to Spacemacs Layers

#+SUMMARY: Experiences modularizing my .spacemacs
#+DRAFT: false

Spacemacs is typically referred to for its evil integration, space-based
keybindings, and its community contributed /layers/. Layers collect, configure,
and integrate groups of packages.

I discuss benefits, approaches, and gotchas associated with using Spacemacs
layers system to organize your personal configuration.

I've migrated my /entire/ ~dotspacemacs/user-config~ into personal layers - it
is now 6 lines as compared to over 1,500.

My viewer-friendly configuration: [[https://github.com/ekaschalk/.spacemacs.d]].

* Layers
** Motivation

** What are Layers

# If you:
# have a lot of config, especially personal pkgs
# value modularity, usability, documentation

** Structure

I recommend maintaining up to 5 layers depending on the size of your config.

- macros :: A base layer that all personal layers inherit packages, macros, and common functions from. For example, I load ~dash-functional~ and define ~with-dir~, ~with-face~, and ~evil-global-set-keys~.

- config :: Package installation, configuration, and keybindings.

- display :: Theme updates and display packages like ~all-the-icons~.

- langs (optional) :: All language configuration.

- personal (optional) :: Personal packages that aren't display or language related. I maintain my Emacs blogging and outline navigation commands here.

* Walkthrough

http://spacemacs.org/doc/LAYERS.html
The [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/LAYERS.org][Spacemacs Layers Documentation]] is fantastic and should be referenced. I
walkthrough its components from setting up a personal configuration perspective.

** layers.el

~layers.el~ declares layer dependencies. Here, we use the ~theming~ layer to
apply face updates to several themes, in my case solarized.

It also loads ~macros~, a personal layer that I use as a base to provide common
functionality to all other personal layers. Specifically, it loads the
 ~dash-functional~ package and provides the ~with-dir~ macro for use in my
personal package ~pretty-eshell~.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(configuration-layer/declare-layers '(theming macros))
#+END_SRC

** packages.el

Packages can be /owned/ through a ~layer-name/init-pkg-name~ function that
always calls at least ~(use-package pkg-name)~.

One and only one layer should own a package. Alternatively, the
 ~dotspacemacs/additional/packages~ list can contain additional packages to
install independent of any layer.

Layers with unowned packages instead use ~layer-name/pre-init-pkg-name~ and
the ~layer-name/post-init-pkg-name~ for adding configuration.
