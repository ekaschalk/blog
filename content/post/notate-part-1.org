#+SUMMARY: Introducing Notate: indentation-aware, visual symbol replacements
#+DRAFT: false

Programming with mathematical notation excites me. I want to
see:

- ~∀~ not ~for~
- ~ℤ~ not ~int~
- ~β~ not ~beta~.

This desire is matched by others. [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] and [[https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig][Hasklig]] fonts have ligatures for
operators like ~>=~ and ~->~ getting us some of the way there.

[[https://xkcd.com/378/]['Course]], there is an Emacs mode to do this: ~prettify-symbols~.

But we can't turn every language into our own, personal APL quite yet...

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(and foo   ; The actual text
     bar)
(∧ foo     ; What we see when working - bar isn't aligned!
     bar)
(∧ foo     ; What we want to see when working...
   bar)
(and foo   ; But now the true indentation is incorrect!
   bar)
#+END_SRC

Replacements without matching "widths" can break indentation, either your
working or the true indentation.

<a href='{{< relref "prettify-mode.md">}}'>Over two years ago I learned of this
problem</a> and <a href='{{< relref "lig-spacing.org" >}}'>periodically have
taken stabs at it</a>.

*I introduce [[https://github.com/ekaschalk/notate][Notate]], implementing indentation-aware visual symbol replacements.*

* Showcase


* Notes

Notate has solved:

- indentation issues with equal-width replacements.

* Limitations
